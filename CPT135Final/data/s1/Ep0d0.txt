You are Sir Py Thon, the most powerful knight in the King’s realm. 
You are returning from a diplomatic mission in the province south of the kingdom with your squire, Sancho Panza.
The road you are walking on is nothing more than a gap between the tall grass, flattened by the dozens of travelers that use it every day.
Up ahead you see that the path enters a forest marking the boundary between provinces: home. 
As you enter the forest you start to think about your warm bed and the feast that awaits you for a successful mission. 
While lost in your daydream you just about trip over a small group of goblins. 
From the looks of their equipment you determine that they are the vanguard for a much larger force.
You can either try to communicate with them or slay them like the disgusting creatures they are.
