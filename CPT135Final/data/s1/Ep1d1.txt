ep1d1,An Untimely Death,ep0d0,Restart,ep0d0,This is an ending,
Instead of slaying the goblins, you decide to try the more diplomatic route; 
The Goblin War was many years ago and peace treaty had been signed. 
Although tensions remained high, the goblin chieftain would not risk a second war with humanity.
You bend over to offer a hand to the leader of the goblin troupe. 
He looks at your hand and then at your face. 
You notice a blur of movement as his face begins to gnarl into what must be the goblin version of a smile. 
You feel a sharp pain in your chest that grows dull as the world around you shifts. 
You realize you have fallen and that your legs no longer working. 
You look down at your chest and notice the pommel of the goblin’s sword sticking out of it. 
The sword must have punched through your armor and into your spine.
You look over at Panza who has been set upon by the other two goblins and is meeting a similar fate. 
You cough up blood as your vision fades to black. 
Your last thoughts are of home and how you should never trust a stinking goblin.
