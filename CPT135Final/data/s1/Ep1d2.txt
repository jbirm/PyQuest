You pull you sword from its sheathe before the goblins have time to react, and slay all three with one swing.
“Excellent form, my lord!” Panza shouts from behind a tree. “There will no doubt be more of them further ahead. 
I shall try to be as vigilant as you from here on out.”
“Hrrmm mhmm,” you mumble, scolding yourself for being surprised by goblins.
The next few hours went by without incident and the forest gives way to farmland. 
The road widens slightly to accommodate farmers’ carts and you reach the town of Millstone as the sun sets.
The town itself is unimpressive; maybe two dozen buildings, almost all single-story homes built of wood sourced from the forest. 
The town seems devoid of all people and you begin to wonder if the goblins had already been through it. 
Then you realize goblins would take no prisoners and there would be more carnage. 
You hear the shouts and screams of people coming from the center of the town. You draw your sword and charge towards it. 
You arrive in the edge of the town square and view a crowd of people, the townsfolk, gathered around a man standing up on scaffolding. 
The man is making gestures with his hands to quiet the townsfolk. There is a well located in the town square. 
On the north side of the square is a church, on the east is a tavern, on the west is the smithy, and to the south is a tailor and bakery separated by the road.
Panza notes that some of the townsfolk have armed themselves and that you should be cautious while approaching them. 
But you wonder if this has something to do with the goblins you saw earlier. 
Approaching them with your weapon drawn would let them know you mean business but might make hinder any discussion you try to have.
If you approach them without your weapon would make you seem more friendly, but you would be at a disadvantage if things got ugly.
