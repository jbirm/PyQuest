"Lock S-Foils and run attack positions!" you declare into your comm piece.
After a quick flight you meet enemy fighters in the cold of space, many of your flight begin dog fights.
One particulary pesky enemy catches you on your six, the red lasers whiz past your cockpit.
Weaving in and out the enemy fighter keeps up with your maneuvers, even as you pick up speed.

You pound your fist into the console and weigh your options quickly.
Do you perform a barrell roll, or do you suddenly drop your speed?
