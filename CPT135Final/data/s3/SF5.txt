SF5,Scratch one bogey,SF6,Bomb the Capital Ship,SF7,Clear the bombers,
In a moment of pure genius you decide to stomp on the brakes, so to speak.
Your starfighter quickly drops its speed by its forward thrusters pushing back.
The enemy flies past you opening them up to your barrage of blue lasers.
"Scratch one bogey!" you exclaim.
With no time to celebrate you see a wing of enemy bombers making a straight path right to your capital ship.
At the same time you also see that their capital ship is clear of defenders for the moment.
Do you decide to do a bombing run on the enemy capital ship, or go and defend yours of the enemy bombers?
