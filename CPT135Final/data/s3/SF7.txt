Deciding that it is a better call to defend your home ship you call your wing and double back.
The slow moving and large bombers are easy targets for the versatile and quick Gladius'.
One by one you destroy the enemy bomber wing keeping your capital ship safe.
"Return to the ship, we will commence bombardment..." you hear on your radio.
In a blaze of lasery glory the enemy capital ship is annihilated in the bombardment.
You and your wing celebrate a well earned victory in the ships bar.
